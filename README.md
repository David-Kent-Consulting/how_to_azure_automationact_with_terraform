OVERVIEW
========
This public repository has been created to show cloud programmers how to create an Azure
automation account using Terraform. We cover all of the steps that Microsoft had once
covered in Azure Issue 4431. Unfortunately Microsoft removed the issue report with
what was an excellent code example. This is our way of helping the developer community
who has helped us on so many times.
